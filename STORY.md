Starting view: The player starts in their "home"
plane, a stark, plain area with little to do. We
start the player in the lower center of this room.
At this point all the player can do is walk around
and the only interesting thing to observe is their
"prized object", directly in front of them.

As the player moves towards this object, they
quickly realize that it's not actually accessible:
it is surrounded by an impenetrable [wall type thing].
Directly above this wall however (top center) is
something curious: the player's first glimpse of
a "rift." This temporal distortion is visibly
unstable, and invites the player to explore it.

When the player enters the unstable circle, a
[mysterious plot hole] causes them to get dropped
through it, into the first area. They'll therefore
enter this area from the top-center, with no obvious
way to return to their home area for some time.

Mechanics:

One Room, Many Views - the player is traversing
one physical space in multiple planes of existance.
Each plane has its own thematic layout, but stil
occupies the same physical space. The player is
never able to teleport physically, but instead can
shift from one plane to another to traverse the
space.

Pinching - Certain room objects, and later player
controlled objects, can "pinch" two planes of
existence together. This causes a radius around
that objects to expand and glow. Anything from the
source plane is then available in the destination
plane, allowing the player to bring objects from
one plane to another, and use them to solve puzzles.

Anchor - A fixed pedestal in a plane, which accepts
a colored key provided by the player. This key
causes some other plane to be brought into the
current world, based on the key itself.

Planar Key - When inserted into an anchor, brings
the key's region of influence into the plane
that the anchoir belongs to. For example, a red key
would pull in part of the fire world when inserted
into an anchor in the blue water world.

Skeleton Key - A more powerful key, when inserted
into an anchor, allows the player to bring any
other plane into this space. This powerful item
comes later in the game, and is mostly useful as
a second set of keys for the player, allowing them
to make multiple pinches with the same color for
the first time.

Areas:

=== Home ===
A stark, white, nearly empty plane. The
player starts here for unexplained reasons, and
may return to it at several points. Acts as a hub
world for faster access to areas. (No need to have
the player backtrack unnecessarily)

Central to this room is the object of the player's
affection. They'll spend the entire game trying to
figure out how to access this central room, and
when they finally do, the game is won.

=== Mansion ===
A large, grey (stone?) interior, with
red carpets and gold trim. Filled with all sorts
of large, heavy objects and medieval mechanisms.

We want the player to enter this area initially
from the bottom center. It has a wide open great
hall with lower rooms off to each side. Along the
back is a grand staircase that branches out and
leads to a second layer up top, and more rooms
off to each side.
